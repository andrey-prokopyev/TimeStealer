	//AFROSHAMAN ASSET PACK
	
	//First of all, thanks for purchasing this asset! I hope it fits perfectly in your project.
	
	/*The package consists of:
	
	***Two versions (prefabs) of the model, one of them appropriate for console and PC games (12.9 k tris, 2048 textures, facial animation and clothes simulation)
	   and a mobile friendly version of the model (2 k tris, 512 and 128 textures, no facial animation and more economic about performance).
	   
	***Each of this versions has two different models (prefabs too). One of them whith a skeleton animated by me, with all the animations displayed in the animation doc,
	   and another model with an humanoid skeleton type, ready to be easily animated with mecanim.   
	 
	***The PC-console versions of the model have a cloth modifier aplied to the cloth, that you can configure as you like. 
	
	***PC-console model (13k tris) uses two materials: Body PC-CONSOLE and Asset PC-CONSOLE.
	
	***Mobile friendly model (1.6 k tris) uses three materials: body mobile, assets mobile and feather mobile. 
	
	***To assign purchased or downloaded animations from the Asset Store, or use your own, just create a new animator controller, drag the 
	   animations you like, configure the transitions between them, and assign this animation controller to the mecanim ready model (prefab). 
	
	***I have also incluided a weapon, that can be replaced by another.
	
	***There is an animated bone in the meshes folder named weapon EFFECT BONE, I used to show the weapons falling to the ground when the character dies in the test scene, 
	   but there are not incluided in the prefabs. You can use it if you find useful.
	
	***I really hope you like the asset, and for any problems or concerns, please contact me at Pelo3d@outlook.es   or   amarok.pelo@gmail.com
